This script is a fork of Aleksandar Jelenak's script further modified by Gray Grissiom.

It is a ftplugin for PO file (GNU gettext) editing.

Gray Grissiom fixed two bugs and added three other functions and remapped the keys.

I fixed a bug preventing the PO-Revision-Date from being updated on some po files. I also changed
some shortcuts.

Thanks to Aleksandar Jelenak and Gray Grissiom a lot. Detailed description can be found in the source file.
